There are two modes:

Infinite mode with Alan Walker: Faded on inifite loop (blocks are randomly generated)


Level mode with Linkin Park: Faint (blocks are synced with music according to the BeatSabre version)


Correct hit is +1 point, wrong direction is -3 points, wrong color is -5 points and wrong color + direction is -8 points.
Missing a block completely is -10 points. If your score falls below 0, the game mode ends.
You can leave the game mode at any time by pressing the Teleport button.
